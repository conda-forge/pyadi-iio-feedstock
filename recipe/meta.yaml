  description: |
    To simplify the use of different devices a python package was created interface
    with the different IIO drivers. The module pyadi-iio, provides device-specific
    APIs built on top of the current libIIO python bindings. These interfaces try to
    match the driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the
    complexities of libIIO and IIO. In general, if you are familiar with python this
    is a great starting point for using different ADI parts and can even run on some
    ADI development systems as well.
